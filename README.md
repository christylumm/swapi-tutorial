# Star Wars API Tutorial

## Objective
Write a tutorial walking the reader through how to use the [Star Wars Open API](https://swapi.dev/) to search for a movie that features Luke Skywalker.

## Additional Info
* It is safe to assume the audience / reader is a developer with technical knowledge
* The total length should not exceed 1000 words (1-3 traditional pages)
* Aim to cover multiple steps using the API, but you do not need to create an exhaustive guide outlining all of the API functionality
* The sample must be written in markdown, showing proper use of markdown formatting
* Sample should be submitted as a link to a gist or repo on GitHub so that we can view the raw markdown
